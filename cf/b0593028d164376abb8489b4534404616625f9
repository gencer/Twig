what about throwing a silenced deprecation, according to the Symfony way to handle them ?

as it is silenced, it will not hurt other projects not following this pattern (they just won't display it), unless they have a crappy error handler turning silenced errors into exceptions (which would break tons of libraries anyway)

@fabpot any feedback on the warning ?

@stof I've just added the `trigger_error` call.

:+1: (we should make a pass on other deprecated methods in Twig btw)
