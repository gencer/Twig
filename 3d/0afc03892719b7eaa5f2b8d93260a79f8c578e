Sounds like a good idea to me. The C extension must also be updated.

@fabpot Thank's for your quick reply.

I'm trying to update the C extension, but I'm facing difficulties to use `ucfirst`.

Is there something specific to do in order to use this php function ? I tried to call `php_ucfirst` instead, unsuccessfully.
Or should I write a `TWIG_UCFIRST` in pure C ?

``869 additions, 856 deletions`` in the C code looks wrong to me (and prevents reviewing btw, as github does not display the diff)

@stof Use of `ucfirst` was more a matter of convention, I removed it.
The too large diff for the C extension was coming from my editor that unexpectedly replaced tabs by spaces. I fixed it.
Many thanks for your help.

@fabpot Now, it seems to be working well with and without the C extension.
