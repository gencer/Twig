``doLeaveNode`` should also reset it then

Yes, maybe resetting there too or as an alternative only there is also possible I think, as with safeVars.

Just to know what to do in my current project where this issue came up: should I rename all my blocks in txt twig templates to be sure or is this (or another fix for this) to be merged and released soon?

Kind regards
Uwe
