Anything which can be applied in 1.x should be applied there, to simplify maintenance (as we merge 1.x into master regularly)

master is Twig 3.x, so this should be switched to 2.x.

> master is Twig 3.x

you are starting the dev of 3.x before even releasing 2.0 ?
And is it really worth starting to maintain a third major version already ?
