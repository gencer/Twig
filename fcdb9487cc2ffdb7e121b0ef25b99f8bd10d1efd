There is no order here. This is a list of names you can use, and when using named argeuments, there is no order anymore.

@fabpot well, IMO, the arguments should still be given in the right order, so that this documents the usage of positional args at the same time

But I'm not sure that this is true everywhere. I did not enforced that when I wrote the documentation AFAIR.

Ok, the few filters that I checked had their arguments in the "right" order. Nevertheless, it would be more intuitive and may reduce confusion for beginners.
