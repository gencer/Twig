Tests must be updated to ensure that the right exception classes are used for these cases

Looks good to me. Can you add some tests? Also, can you add an entry in the CHANGELOG file? Thanks.

Absolutely. Will work on that now. Thanks @fabpot and @stof

I've enhanced the existing tests in Twig_Tests_Extension_SandboxTest to assert the new exception classes and their methods (and the older exception classes, which weren't previously covered). I also split the large test out into several more discrete tests.

Hope this is all okay.

Sorry, removed the PHP 5.5 `::class` syntax in favour of plain strings.
