And of course, I've just had a look at Symfony, and we are using this method in the Twig form extension. I need to see why and how to fix that.

Ok, it's probably to avoid a circular reference, we can probably find another way.

@fabpot I suggest finding the solution in Symfony before merging this. but otherwise, :+1:

To keep BC, I've added a new interface: `Twig_Extension_InitRuntimeInterface` which can be implemented if really needed (see changes for more information).

Not sure why it does not work on 5.2.
