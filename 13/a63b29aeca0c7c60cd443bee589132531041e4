What about the other deprecations in 2.0? Shouldn't we remove them all?

@fabpot makes sense, code is updated

I would not add TODOs. The best I think would be to remove everything and submit a PR re-adding everything back just after this one is merged. So that we can easily keep track of everything without polluting 2.0. WDYT?

Fine for me too. I simply removed these things so that we could just revert this one commit later for 2.1.
