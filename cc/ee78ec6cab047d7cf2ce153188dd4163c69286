@fabpot Any thoughts on that? Do you think this is the correct way to go? We're just upgrading from Twig 1.x to Twig 2.x together with upgrading to PHPUnit 6 and this would have helped with a seamless transition for our tests on Twig extensions. For now, we've fallen back to a couple of class aliases in our test bootstrap.

Cheers! üçª

@stof Thanks for the feedback! This way this change is not breaking anything at all! Let me know if you want me to squash commits.

@hkdobrev you can squash them if you want, but this is not mandatory. @fabpot has a tool to sqaush things automatically before merging (the drawback is that the PR is considered closed rather than merged, as github cannot detect it as a merge)

Hmm, GitHub has now squashing functionality which if used makes the PR be considered as merged :)

@hkdobrev we don't use the github interface to make merges.

Any reason why this doesn't land in 1.x? Especially since namespaced variant of `TestCase` is available in both PHPUnit 4.8 and 5.4+

@emodric min supported version in Twig 1.x was PHP 5.2, so using the namespaced classes would break it for testcases.
But I would actually be in favor of it. This is up to @fabpot

Anything else needed here to merge? Cheers!

I think doing that on 1.x is fine. We just need to warn people and bump version to the next min one.

Rebased on top of `1.x` and changed base branch of the PR.
