Can you also update the docs?

Could be considered a BC break which happens when you have a magic getter and a hasser on your object. It will now choose the other one.

Add a line to the docs. @Tobion is right about the fact that this can be considered a BC break (it was never stated before that hasser methods do work too so this hardly is a bugfix).

What about adding this to Twig 2.0 only?

We could also swap the order of the checks for the hasser method and the magic `__call()` method, but merging into 2.0 would be okay for me too.

+1 in 2.0. Does this have an performance impact? If I remember right, hasser support was proposed before already (although I could not find it anymore).

I don't see any performance impact (the available class methods are cached anyway and `isset()` is in O(1)).
