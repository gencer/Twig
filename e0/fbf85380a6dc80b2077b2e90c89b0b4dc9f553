Assetic relies on ``getFunction`` currently. However, it might be possible to avoid it thanks to changes I did when adding support for Twig 2.x. I will look into it after my vacations (which start today for 1 week)

@stof any news on this one?

I haven't worked on Assetic again. I will need to do it (I forgot about this discussion)

@fabpot I did the change in Assetic (was even easier than I though actually). See the PR linked above
