@arjenjb The twig extension seems to work for PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4.
But on PHP 5.2 the build didn't work: https://travis-ci.org/fabpot/Twig/jobs/5523865

I cannot reproduce this bug on a local machine. I have compiled it with exactly the same PHP version, and the extension compiles without errors. btw, the compile error occurs in a function I didn't touch, so I suppose this error should have occured before?

Btw, in the C extension code the PHP equivalent code is in the comments. But this is not in synch anymore. So it should be updated as well.
