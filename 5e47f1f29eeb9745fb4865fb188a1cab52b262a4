Thank you very much, stof.

Some more fix I need (for PHP 5.2 error in travis)

I removed a testcase because which is covered by integration test.

you should have a test using an immutable datetime instance (the test being skipped for older php version than 5.5)

added testcase annotated with 'requires PHP 5.5'.

I'll add integration test case.

added integration test for DateTimeImmutable (CONDITION >= PHP 5.5.0)
and re-remove unit testcase.
