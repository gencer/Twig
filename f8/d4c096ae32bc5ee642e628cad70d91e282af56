LGTM. Can you add some tests and a note in the CHANGELOG file?

@fabpot done. Hope the tests look like what you expected, otherwise please guide me.

Failing tests on PHP 7 only, seems unrelated.

@fabpot Took care of your feedback, also from #2426 which has been merged into this one.

@fabpot Do you think this could make it into the next Twig release?

Can you rebase to get rid of the merge commit? I will then review it and make any additional comment before merge and release. Thanks.
