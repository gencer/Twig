üëç as Twig 2 relies on PHP 7.

It would be great to have a fix for Twig 1.x though (which cannot be this one, at least not always, due to the PHP version support)

1.x is not broken (it uses mb_strlen rather than null/a number), this code was optimized/simplified in 2.x

Changing it wouldn't be too hard, but it depends on which minimal php version is supposed to be supported. Its probably not really worth it (especially not if < 5.4.8 is supported), since a version-check would make the code more complicated. Otherwise its just a matter of replacing the mb_strlen-call with null.

Well, if 1.x is not broken, then fine
