@fabpot what about Twig_Source, Twig_FileExtensionEscapingStrategy, Twig_NodeTraverser, Twig_TokenStream and profiler-related classes ? Should they also be tagged as ``@final`` ?

@stof I've updated the code. I've not added `@final` on `Twig_FileExtensionEscapingStrategy` as it might make sense to extend its logic.
